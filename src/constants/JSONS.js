Couples who earn about the same amount of income can find themselves pushed into a higher tax bracket when their family income roughly doubles after they marry. On the other hand, if one spouse earns significantly less income than the other, you may pay a lower total tax as a couple if you file joint returns. The standard deduction for married couples filing jointly is double that of a single individual.",

(The divorce is “finalized” when the court issues your final divorce decree.) Otherwise you are still considered married for tax purposes and can still file a joint return as a married couple.",

            "Once your divorce is finalized, you’ll need to divide up the kids for tax purposes. Only one parent can claim each child as a dependent on his or her (separate) tax return. Generally it’s the parent with whom the child lived for most of the year (usually the custodial parent). Also, the parent who claims the deduction must be providing over half of the child’s financial support, and he/she must be under 19 years of age, or 24 if a full-time student in college. If you do qualify to claim one or more of your children as a dependent after your divorce, you will be able to file your taxes as Head of Household, which has advantages."]

        paras: ["Alimony, or spousal support, is financial support that one spouse is legally obligated to pay to the other after a divorce. It is separate from child support; alimony is only for the divorced spouse. The laws regarding alimony vary widely from one state to the next, and is often at the discretion of the judge. Some states require that the marriage lasted ten years or more before a judge will grant alimony, and in some states a spouse may only collect alimony for a certain period of time, often for three or four years. In the past, alimony was always paid by the ex-husband to the ex-wife back in the days when most wives did not have jobs outside the home, but times have changed and today it is often based on income and is paid by the higher-earning spouse to the lesser-earning spouse. Alimony payments are usually determined as part of the divorce settlement.",

            "The tax aspects of alimony have changed. Spouses who pay alimony can no longer deduct it from their taxes, and spouses who receive alimony must include it as taxable income."]

        paras: ["Child support is financial support that one spouse is legally obligated to pay for the care and maintenance of a child after divorce. It is based on the premise that parents are obligated to support their children even when the children are not living with them. Child support is totally separate from custody and visitation rights, and courts can require a non-custodial parent to help support their child even if the parent does not have any contact or parental relationship with the child. If the parent challenges their obligation to pay child support by denying paternity, the court can order blood or DNA testing to establish paternity. Child support payments are usually determined as part of the divorce settlement."]

        paras: ["The question of who owns the engagement ring, and who has the right to keep it if the engagement is broken and the wedding is called off, varies from state to state and often depends on the circumstances.",

            "In some states, the engagement ring is considered a promise of marriage. If the wedding is cancelled, the promise is broken and the bride must return the ring. In other states, the ring is considered a gift with no strings attached and is not subject to return. In some states it depends who was at fault for breaking the engagement: if the bride cancels the wedding because the groom cheated during the engagement, she keeps the ring. There is one notable exception to all this: in most states if the ring was a family heirloom from the groom’s family, it must be returned to the groom if the engagement is broken.",


            "Most states don’t have laws about what happens to the engagement ring in the event of a divorce. In states that consider the ring a promise of marriage, once that promise was kept and the couple is married, the ring usually becomes the bride’s separate property not to be divided in a divorce settlement. A few states consider the engagement ring to be community property and fair game in a divorce settlement. In some states it depends who was at fault for the breakup of the marriage.",

            "So before you spend the price of a brand-new luxury car on a diamond ring, it might be worth checking out what the laws in your state say about getting it back if the wedding doesn’t happen, or if you later get divorced."]
